# Chatroom
This java project is a simple chatroom in commandline, built using java.net utilities. Several users can connect to the server using multithreading in java and view other's messages. The server code runs on local host but can be changed to take a host address to connect to a remote server.

First, run Server.java file, then run the Client.java file several times in different terminal tabs.
